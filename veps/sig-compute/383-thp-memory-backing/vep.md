## Overview

This enhancement allows VMs declaring hugepages to run without pre-allocated static hugepages on the node. Instead, guest memory is backed by regular anonymous pages collapsed into Transparent Huge Pages (THP) at runtime using `MADV_COLLAPSE`. Combined with `mlock` and immediate preallocation, high THP coverage can deliver TLB performance close to static hugepages. With `policy: bestEffort`, coverage is opportunistic and TLB benefit is not guaranteed.

The native THP size is architecture-dependent (2M on x86_64, 1M on s390x, etc. — see Architecture Considerations). This VEP uses "THP" generically for the platform's native transparent huge page size.

The VM retains its hugepages declaration in the spec (preserving NUMA topology and domain XML generation), but the pod is built with regular memory resources. virt-handler raises `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` on virtqemud and a collapse call promotes pages to THP after preallocation completes.

THP can selected via a per-VMI API (`hugepages.mode` / `hugepages.policy`). An optional KubeVirt CR cluster default can apply transparent mode with `policy: guaranteed` to hugepage VMIs that omit `mode` as well, so administrators can opt the whole cluster into THP without rewriting every workload. When that cluster configuration is unset, behavior matches today: static hugepages unless the VMI explicitly sets `mode: transparent`.

## Motivation

Static hugepages require cluster-level pre-allocation: administrators must configure nodes with a fixed number of reserved hugepages at boot or runtime. This creates operational burdens:

1. **Capacity planning** — hugepages reserved at boot are unavailable for other workloads, even when no VM uses them.
2. **Scheduling constraints** — VMs can only land on nodes with sufficient pre-allocated hugepages, reducing scheduler flexibility.
3. **NUMA fragmentation** — hugepages must be allocated on the correct NUMA node; imbalanced allocation leads to scheduling failures.
4. **Cluster heterogeneity** — different VM sizes need different hugepage reservations, complicating node profiles.
5. **Operational toil** — changing hugepage reservations requires node reboots or careful runtime tuning with risk of allocation failure.

To simplify operations, an administrator can move the whole cluster to THP with a KubeVirt CR default instead of rewriting every hugepage VMI. Per-VMI `mode` remains for mixed clusters and overrides.

Modern kernels (RHEL 9.2+, upstream 6.1+) support `MADV_COLLAPSE`, which synchronously collapses regular pages into THPs. Combined with `mlock` and immediate preallocation, high THP coverage can deliver TLB performance close to static hugepages without any pre-allocation.

### Proof of Concept

An out-of-tree addon ([kubevirt-hugepages-addon](https://github.com/michalskrivanek/kubevirt-hugepages-addon)) demonstrates feasibility using admission webhooks and a sidecar hook. It requires several runtime workarounds due to operating outside KubeVirt's control plane. Native integration eliminates all of them.

## Goals

- Allow VMs declaring hugepages to run without pre-allocated hugepages on the node.
- Deliver TLB performance close to static hugepages when THP collapse achieves high coverage.
- Preserve existing NUMA topology generation and domain XML structure.
- Use the standard KubeVirt memory overhead calculation — no special buffer hacks.
- Require no changes to libvirt or QEMU.
- Support two collapse policies via `policy`: `bestEffort` (opportunistic collapse) and `guaranteed` (VM fails if collapse does not reach 95% coverage).
- Provide a per-VMI API as the user opt-in, with a cluster-level opt-in for administrators who want THP without rewriting every hugepage VMI.

## Non Goals

- Replacing static hugepages by default — both modes coexist; without an explicit VMI `mode` or an explicit cluster default, behavior remains static hugepages.
- Guaranteeing 100% THP coverage — `policy: guaranteed` enforces a 95% threshold on a cgroup-based estimate, not a per-page guest-RAM guarantee.
- Supporting 1G hugepages dynamically — `MADV_COLLAPSE` targets the architecture's native THP size, not arbitrary sizes.
- Overcommitting guest memory — `<locked/>` prevents swapping; this is a performance feature, not an overcommit feature.
- Modifying the kernel's THP subsystem behavior (defrag, khugepaged tuning).
- Post-copy live migration with `policy: guaranteed` — the coverage check requires full preallocation at domain start; may be added in a future enhancement once incremental collapse timing is defined.

## Definition of Users

- Users running VMs that benefit from hugepages performance but want simpler cluster operations.
- Cluster administrators who want to avoid static hugepage reservation and NUMA planning.
- Cloud providers offering VM-based workloads where hugepage pre-allocation limits bin-packing.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want my VM to get THP performance without requiring hugepages to be pre-allocated on the node.
- As a user, I want to opt a single VMI into THP via `hugepages.mode` without changing cluster-wide defaults.
- As a cluster admin, I want an optional KubeVirt CR default so existing hugepage workloads can use THP without rewriting every VMI.
- As a user, I want my VM to be schedulable on any node with sufficient free memory, not only nodes with hugepages available.
- As a user deploying latency-sensitive workloads, I want guaranteed THP backing with a clear failure signal if the node cannot provide it.
- As a user deploying general-purpose VMs, I want best-effort THP with visibility into actual coverage.

## Design

### API

A new `mode` field is added to `spec.domain.memory.hugepages`. Value `transparent` selects THP backing via `MADV_COLLAPSE`, distinct from the kernel's dynamic hugepage allocation via sysfs (`nr_hugepages`):

```yaml
spec:
  domain:
    memory:
      hugepages:
        pageSize: "2Mi"
        mode: transparent
        policy: bestEffort
```

| Field | Values | Default | Valid when |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| `mode` | `static`, `transparent` | `static` | always |
| `pageSize` | e.g. `"2Mi"` | required when hugepages set | always |
| `policy` | `bestEffort`, `guaranteed` | `bestEffort` | THP mode only |

`mode` accepts two values:
- `static` (default, current behavior) — pod requests hugepages resources, node must have pre-allocated hugepages.
- `transparent` — pod requests regular memory, pages are collapsed to THP at runtime.

Absence of the `mode` field preserves current behavior (`static`), unless cluster `defaultMode` is set.

When THP mode is selected, `pageSize` is retained for NUMA topology and domain XML generation but does **not** control the THP size — the architecture's native THP size applies (see Architecture Considerations).

`policy` controls collapse strictness (only valid when THP mode is selected):
- `bestEffort` (default) — virt-handler runs `MADV_COLLAPSE` once after preallocation. Partial collapse is acceptable; uncovered regions may be promoted later by `khugepaged`. The VMI reaches `Running` regardless of coverage. Pre-copy and post-copy live migration are supported.
- `guaranteed` — same collapse pass, but if coverage falls below 95% the VMI transitions to `Failed` with reason `THPCollapseFailed` and a Kubernetes event with details. The 95% threshold is fixed. Post-copy live migration is not supported because the coverage check requires full preallocation at domain start. A future enhancement may provide a better threshold or improve the accuracy of coverage calculation.

**Known limitation (`policy: guaranteed`):** The coverage check runs after scheduling. `MADV_COLLAPSE` triggers compaction and mitigates fragmentation at the cost of startup latency, but cannot guarantee order-9 blocks if the node genuinely lacks sufficient movable memory. The scheduler is fragmentation-blind, so a failed VMI may reschedule to another unsuitable node and fail again. A future enhancement may integrate fragmentation awareness or per-VMA guest-RAM coverage measurement.

Admission rejects `policy` unless THP mode is selected (VMI `mode: transparent` or cluster `defaultMode: transparent`), and rejects post-copy live migration when `policy` is `guaranteed`.

Administrators can set a cluster default on the KubeVirt CR so hugepage VMIs that omit `mode` use THP without rewriting every workload. That path uses `policy: guaranteed`, matching static hugepages (the VM gets huge pages or it fails).

```yaml
spec:
  configuration:
    hugepages:
      defaultMode: transparent       # static | transparent
```

If cluster `hugepages` is unset, omitted `mode` remains `static` and omitted `policy` remains `bestEffort`. The feature gate alone does not change existing hugepage VMIs.

### Component Changes

#### virt-controller (pod template generation)

When THP mode is selected (VMI `mode: transparent` or cluster `defaultMode: transparent`):

1. **Do not add `hugepages-*` resources** to the compute container. Instead, set `resources.requests.memory` and `resources.limits.memory` to `guest_memory + GetMemoryOverhead()` using the standard overhead formula (same path as non-hugepages VMs).
2. **Do not create the `hugepages` emptyDir volume** with `medium: HugePages`.
3. **Do not mount `/dev/hugepages`** in the compute container. This prevents virt-launcher from writing `hugetlbfs_mount` to `qemu.conf`, which would cause virtqemud to fail initialization.
4. **Set RLIMIT_MEMLOCK requirement** — triggers the VEP 144 mechanism so virt-handler raises the memory lock limit on virtqemud.

#### virt-handler (memory lock and THP collapse)

When a VMI uses THP mode:

1. **Memory lock**: Call `prlimit64` on the virt-launcher/virtqemud process to set `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK = RLIM_INFINITY`. This is the same mechanism already used for VFIO passthrough VMs. When libvirt later processes `<locked/>` in the domain XML and calls `setrlimit`, the limit is already high enough and libvirt's check (`current >= limit`) passes — making it a no-op.

2. **THP collapse**: After QEMU preallocates memory (detected by monitoring `VmLck` stabilization in `/proc/<pid>/status`):
   - Parse `/proc/<pid>/maps` for large anonymous RW regions.
   - Call `process_madvise(pidfd, iov, MADV_COLLAPSE)` to synchronously collapse pages into THPs.
   - For `policy: guaranteed`: if coverage < 95%, transition VMI to `Failed` with reason `THPCollapseFailed` and emit Kubernetes event.
   - For `policy: bestEffort`: fall back to `khugepaged` for regions that cannot be immediately collapsed. Log result, continue.

Coverage is estimated from the virt-launcher pod cgroup, not a per-VMA walk of guest RAM only: `anon_thp / anon` for anonymous backing; when `memoryBacking` source is `memfd` (shmem, e.g. virtiofs/passt shared access), include shmem THP stats as well so coverage is not undercounted. Launcher and sidecar overhead are included; for typical VM sizes guest RAM dominates, so the ratio approximates guest THP backing.

`MADV_COLLAPSE` runs once per domain start, after QEMU immediate preallocation completes — including on the destination node after a pre-copy live migration, once the target QEMU process has faulted in guest memory. Migrated pages arrive as regular 4K pages regardless of source THP backing; THP is re-established on the destination by the same collapse sequence. With `policy: bestEffort`, post-copy migration is supported: memory faults in incrementally on the destination and uncollapsed regions may be promoted by `khugepaged`. With `policy: guaranteed`, post-copy is rejected at admission because the 95% coverage check cannot run until all guest memory is preallocated.

virt-handler already runs privileged on the host with access to process PIDs and `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` — no additional capabilities are needed.

#### Domain converter (XML generation)

When THP mode is selected, the converter generates:

```xml
<memoryBacking>
  <source type="anonymous"/>
  <locked/>
  <allocation mode="immediate"/>
</memoryBacking>
```

Instead of the static hugepages XML:

```xml
<memoryBacking>
  <hugepages>
    <page size="2048" unit="KiB"/>
  </hugepages>
  <source type="memfd"/>
  <locked/>
  <allocation mode="immediate"/>
</memoryBacking>
```

Key differences:
- No `<hugepages>` section — memory is anonymous, not backed by hugetlbfs.
- `<source type="anonymous"/>` — regular anonymous mmap, eligible for THP collapse.
- `<locked/>` — mlocks all QEMU memory, preventing swapping. Same semantics as static hugepages.
- `<allocation mode="immediate"/>` — preallocates and faults all memory at VM start, consistent with static hugepages VMs. A future investigation may tune the libvirt `threads` attribute if benchmarks show a measurable benefit for large THP-mode VMs.

NUMA topology (`<numatune>`, `<cpu><numa>`) is generated identically to static hugepages — the kernel's NUMA policy applies to anonymous pages the same way.

### Session Mode Compatibility

libvirt runs as uid 107 in the virt-launcher container ("session mode"). This has two implications:

1. **`<memtune><hard_limit>` is rejected** — libvirt does not support memory tuning in session mode because it cannot manipulate cgroups as non-root.
2. **libvirt cannot raise `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` itself** — when processing `<locked/>`, libvirt calls `setrlimit(RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, RLIM_INFINITY)` on the QEMU child process. This fails with `EPERM` because virtqemud lacks `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` (virt-launcher only passes `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` as an ambient capability).

The design addresses both by having **virt-handler set the limit externally** before domain creation. virt-handler runs as root on the host and calls `prlimit64` to set `RLIM_INFINITY` on the virtqemud process. When libvirt subsequently attempts `setrlimit`, it finds `current >= requested` and the call becomes a no-op. This is the same proven pattern used for VFIO passthrough VMs.

### Memory Overhead

When THP mode is selected, KubeVirt uses its **standard (non-hugepages) memory overhead formula**. No special calculation is needed because:

- With static hugepages: guest RAM is in the `hugetlb` cgroup controller (not charged to `memory` cgroup), so the `memory` resource only needs to cover QEMU process overhead.
- With THP mode: guest RAM is in the `memory` cgroup (like any normal VM), so `memory` resource = guest + overhead — the same path as any non-hugepages VM.

The standard overhead formula already accounts for page tables, QEMU buffers, and kernel tracking structures for regular memory. No additional buffer is needed.

### Status Reporting

No new VMI status fields or conditions are introduced. Collapse coverage is logged.

For `policy: guaranteed` failure:

```yaml
status:
  phase: Failed
```

A Kubernetes event with reason `THPCollapseFailed` carries coverage details (e.g. "Only 45% THP coverage achieved; node lacks free order-9 blocks").

### Feature Gate

`THPMemoryBacking`

## Alternatives

### Sidecar-based addon (current PoC)

**Description**: External admission webhooks mutate VMI and Pod objects; a sidecar hook rewrites domain XML and calls `prlimit64` on virtqemud.

**Pros**:
- No KubeVirt code changes required.
- Can be deployed independently on existing clusters.

**Cons**:
- Requires several runtime workarounds (shared PID namespace, root sidecar, capability elevation, SCC patches, mount redirection, socket umask, memory buffer hacks).
- Fragile — depends on KubeVirt's internal pod structure remaining stable across versions.
- Security: sidecar runs as root with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` + `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`.
- Memory overhead calculation is imprecise (adds a fixed 1 GiB buffer instead of using KubeVirt's formula).

### Kernel-level always-THP without mlock

**Description**: Rely on `transparent_hugepage=always` and let the kernel promote pages passively via khugepaged.

**Pros**:
- Zero code changes anywhere.

**Cons**:
- No guarantee of THP promotion timing — khugepaged is asynchronous and may take hours for large allocations.
- Without `mlock`, guest memory can be swapped under pressure, causing unpredictable latency spikes.
- No preallocation — page faults during VM runtime cause jitter.
- Cannot guarantee NUMA locality of promotions.

### API-less cluster-only conversion

**Description**: No VMI `mode`/`policy` fields at all. Enabling a KubeVirt CR flag converts every hugepage VMI to transparent THP (typically `guaranteed`).

**Pros**:
- Zero user YAML change once the admin enables the feature.
- Smaller API surface.

**Cons**:
- Breaks existing hugepage scheduling semantics for all workloads when enabled (resources flip from `hugepages-*` to ordinary memory).
- No per-VMI `bestEffort` vs `guaranteed` without extra escape hatches.
- Risky rollback: disabling the flag returns VMIs to static hugepages that may no longer schedule if nodes have no `nr_hugepages`.
- Poor fit for mixed clusters that still need real hugetlb (e.g. `pageSize: 1Gi`).

## Scalability

The THP collapse does a one-shot operation at VM startup (1-3 seconds for 18 GiB of guest memory). This may be noticeable for large VMs, however there is no ongoing CPU or memory overhead after collapse completes.

Node scheduling capacity improves compared to static hugepages: VMs compete for generic `memory` resources instead of scarce architecture-specific hugepage resources, enabling better bin-packing across the cluster.

## Update/Rollback Compatibility

- New fields are optional; omission or a rollback without `THPMemoryBacking` preserves static hugepages behavior when cluster `configuration.hugepages` is also unset.
- Running VMs are unaffected until restart or migration.

## Functional Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

- virt-controller generates correct pod spec for THP mode (no hugepages resources, correct memory limits, no hugetlbfs volume, no `/dev/hugepages` mount).
- Domain converter generates correct XML (`<memoryBacking>` with anonymous source, locked, immediate allocation, no hugepages).
- Memory overhead calculation matches the standard non-hugepages path.
- NUMA topology generation is identical for both static and THP modes.
- virt-handler sets RLIMIT_MEMLOCK for THP-mode VMs.
- Admission rejects `policy` unless THP mode is selected and rejects post-copy migration when `policy` is `guaranteed`.
- Mode/policy resolution: VMI fields override cluster defaults; cluster `defaultMode: transparent` implies `guaranteed` unless the VMI sets `policy`; unset cluster config yields `static` / `bestEffort`.

### E2E Tests

**Alpha:**

- VM with THP mode starts successfully on a node with zero pre-allocated hugepages.
- VM with THP mode achieves >95% THP coverage from cgroup memory stats (`anon_thp / anon` and/or shmem THP metrics, as appropriate for anonymous vs memfd backing).
- VM with `policy: guaranteed` and insufficient node memory fails with `THPCollapseFailed`.
- With `defaultMode: transparent`, a hugepage VMI omitting `mode` uses THP with `policy: guaranteed`.

**Beta:**

- VM with THP mode and NUMA passthrough respects NUMA binding.
- Pre-copy live migration of a THP-mode VM preserves THP coverage on the destination node.

## Prerequisites

- KubeVirt with VEP 144 (Memory Lock RLimit configuration) at Beta or GA — provides the `prlimit64` mechanism on virt-handler.
- Kernel with `MADV_COLLAPSE` support: RHEL 9.2+ (kernel-5.14.0-284+) or upstream kernel 6.1+.
- THP enabled on the node: `/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` set to `always` or `madvise`.

## Graduation Requirements

### Alpha

- Feature gate `THPMemoryBacking`.
- virt-controller: generate pod spec without hugepages resources/volumes for THP-mode VMs.
- Domain converter: generate anonymous/locked/immediate XML.
- virt-handler: set `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`, run `MADV_COLLAPSE`, support both `bestEffort` and `guaranteed` policies.
- Unit tests for all components.
- E2E tests: startup without pre-allocated hugepages, >95% coverage, guaranteed-policy failure path, cluster `defaultMode` applies THP with `guaranteed`.

### Beta

- E2E tests: NUMA binding, pre-copy migration.
- Documentation.
- Revisit `policy: guaranteed`, especially how to improve startup failures(fragmentation-blind scheduler, reschedule loops).

### GA

- Remove feature gate.
- Proven in production with diverse workloads and node configurations.
- Node readiness reporting (THP capability in node conditions or labels).

### Architecture Considerations

`MADV_COLLAPSE` is architecture-independent (defined in generic UAPI headers, available on all architectures with `CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE`). The native THP size is determined by the architecture's PMD granularity:

| Architecture | Base page | Native THP size |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| x86_64 | 4K | 2M |
| aarch64 (4K pages) | 4K | 2M |
| aarch64 (64K pages) | 64K | 512M |
| s390x | 4K | 1M |
| ppc64le (radix, 4K) | 4K | 2M |
| ppc64le (64K pages) | 64K | 16M |

The feature works on all architectures, but the TLB pressure reduction benefits vary significantly with native THP size. On x86_64 and aarch64 (4K), collapsing 512 PTEs into a single PMD entry provides a direct and well-understood performance improvement. On architectures with very large native THP (512M on aarch64-64K, 16M on ppc64le-64K), the collapse granularity is coarser and the tradeoffs differ.

Alpha targets x86_64. Other architectures are expected to work but are validated in later stages.
